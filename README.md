# README

This project is part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Curriculum. [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project]

The project will serve to showcase and practice understanding of 
- building new rails applications
- modelling data
- working with forms
- working with simple API's
- Devise and Omniauth authentications
etc.

The goal of the project is to build a mock Facebook website. The primary focus is to get the data and the back end working properly by building the core feautures involving users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking” as well as implementing a sign-in ability with the real Facebook by using Omniauth and Devise.

Styling will be added in the near future as I complete the course and learn more about styling.
